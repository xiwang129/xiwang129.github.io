I am an MS in Computer Science student at NYU Courant and a research associate at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. I am broadly interested in AI for Science, particularly in generative models for scientific discovery, optimal transport, differential geometry, and physics-informed machine learning. In a previous life, I worked as a reporter at a business magazine in NY, covering macroeconomics, tech companies, and US-Asia. I also studied international relations and economics at Johns Hopkins University.
