I am an MS in computer science student at NYU Courant and a research associate at NYU Grossman School of Medicine Department of Radiology, working on cardiac MRI research. I am interested in generative models, optimal transport, differential geometry, and AI for Science. In a previous life, I worked as a reporter at a business magazine in NY, covering macroeconomics, tech companies, and US-Asia. I also studied international relations and economics at Johns Hopkins University.
