I am an MS in Computer Science student at NYU Courant and a research associate at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Broadly, I work on AI for Science, focusing on theory-driven generative models and physics-informed machine learning for biomedicine. My interests include generative modeling and sampling for biology, optimal transport, differential geometry, and scientific machine learning for solving PDEs. Before research, I worked as a reporter at a business magazine in New York, covering macroeconomics, tech companies, and U.S.–Asia relations. I also studied international relations and economics at Johns Hopkins University.
